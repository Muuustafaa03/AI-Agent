# AI Agent 🤖 — Research & Action (LAMP + Python)

A full-stack, Dockerized **AI research assistant** that ingests URLs or raw text and generates:
- **Research Briefs**
- **Technical Summaries**
- **Task Breakdowns**
- **Topic Classifications**
- **PRD Outlines**

It records **telemetry** (latency, tokens, cost, model version), stores **artifacts**, and ships with a **dark-mode analytics dashboard** + CSV/JSON export.

---

## 🧭 Motivation / Problem Statement

**Problem.** Analysts, PMs, and researchers spend hours summarizing documents, tracking AI costs manually, and debugging LLM failures without visibility.  

**Solution.** A transparent, locally hostable AI agent that:
- Accepts URLs or text
- Outputs structured summaries instantly
- Tracks tokens, cost, latency, and model versions
- Stores editable artifacts in JSON/TXT
- Provides a built-in analytics dashboard — no external APM required

**Goal:** Deliver a *traceable, measurable, developer-first* AI summarization system.

## 🧪 Design Decisions & Trade-offs

| Decision                                     | Why                                                 | Trade-off                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **PHP/Python split**                         | PHP = simple orchestration, Python = strong AI SDKs | Requires Docker networking      |
| **Hybrid persistence (DB + files)**          | JSON/TXT are portable & inspectable                 | Must keep artifact paths synced |
| **Client-side Markdown preview (marked.js)** | Faster, safer rendering                             | Depends on browser JS           |
| **Chart.js**                                 | Lightweight, dark-mode ready                        | Less interactive than full BI   |
| **Local telemetry**                          | Zero vendor lock-in                                 | Manual aggregation              |
| **TailwindCSS**                              | Utility-first styling, quick dark mode              | Slightly verbose HTML classes   |

| `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` | Token counts                           |
| `est_cost_usd`                        | Estimated API cost                     |
| `model_version`                       | OpenAI model used                      |

* Task Breakdown (short text): <0.5 s, ≈200 tokens, ≈$0.0003

All metrics visualized in the **Analytics Dashboard**.

* [ ] OAuth-based user runs
* [ ] Smart page caching for URLs
* [ ] Embedding-based semantic search
* [ ] Multi-model performance comparison in Analytics

## 🧩 Architecture / System Design Summary

**Data Flow:**

1. User submits text or URL
2. PHP inserts new run in DB → calls Python worker
3. Worker fetches content → generates summary via OpenAI
4. Worker sends telemetry back (tokens, latency, cost)
5. PHP stores artifact file + metrics in MySQL
6. Dashboard visualizes results in real-time

## 🧩 Technical Decisions (Deep Dive)

* **LAMP baseline:** simplicity and instant routing over framework complexity.
* **Dockerized isolation:** consistent across dev, staging, prod.
* **OpenAI API:** best trade-off between quality, reliability, and dev speed.
* **TailwindCSS:** fast styling consistency, easy dark/light toggling.
* **Chart.js:** small footprint, enough power for telemetry trends.
* **Local telemetry:** avoids external APM costs, perfect for self-contained observability.

## 🧭 Motivation Recap

**Goal:** Create a measurable, interpretable, developer-first AI system.
**Result:** A locally hostable, full-stack, telemetry-enabled AI summarization agent with persistent outputs, analytics, and export tools — all open, simple, and portable.
